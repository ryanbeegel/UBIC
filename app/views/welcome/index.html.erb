    <h3>Interested In Investing?
      <p>Students within the School of Management are proud to announce the creation of The University at Buffalo Investment Club (UBIC). UBIC is a School of Management organization always looking to recruit individuals to be part of a $30,000,000 student-run virtual hedge fund. Club membership will grant students an opportunity for hands on experience in specific segments of capital markets and be part of a student investment group.  Our aim is to enhance investment knowledge, teach students how to manage a competitive portfolio and will introduce you into the world of equity research, valuation and experience.</p>
 
      <p>Our intention here at the UBIC is to provide students with a strong foundation in the functioning of the capital markets.  We seek to involve students in the research, analysis, and maintenance of a securities portfolio using a hands-on approach that would effectively bridge the gap between classroom concepts and real world situations.</p>
